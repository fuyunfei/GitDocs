\section*{\centering ABSTRACT}
Bas-relief is an art form part way between 3D sculpture and 2D painting. We present a new approach for generating a bas-relief from a single Chinese brush painting.We do not aim to recover exact depth of a painting, which is a tricky computer vision problem, requiring assumptions that are rarely satisfied.Instead, our approach exploits the concept of brush strokes, making each brush stroke possible to generate a correspond bas-relief proxies(depth map of brush strokes),and combine the depth map of brush strokes together to construct the bas-relief model. To segment brush strokes in 2D paintings, we apply layer decomposition and stroke segmentation by imposing boundary constraints, which can make strokes smooth and complete. The resulting brush strokes are sufficient to evoke the impression of the consistent 3D shapes on bas-relief, so that they may be further edited. Currently, our research focus on Chinese brush paintings.We demonstrate our approach is able to produce convincing bas-reliefs from a variety of Chinese brush paintings, and even some other suitable styles include rosemaling paintings. \\
As a secondary application, we show how our brush stroke extraction algorithm could be used for image editing.And our brush stroke extraction algorithm is specifically geared to handling paintings with each brush stroke drawn very purposefully, in addition to Chinese paintings, other suitable styles include rosemailing paintings and Vincent van Gogh's oil paintings.
