\chapter{INTRODUCTION}

\section{Background}
Relief is a method of sculpture in which forms are carved into a
relatively flat surface. In essence, it creates a bridge between a full 3D sculpture and a 2D painting. On this spectrum,high relief is closest to full 3D, whereas flatter artworks are described as bas-relief. Among all the sculpture forms, bas-relief is the closest to 2D paintings\cite{kerber2009feature} \cite{barron2012color}.\\ \\
Bas-relief sculpting has been practiced for thousands of years.Since antiquity, artisans from many ancient cultures(including Greek, Persian, Egyptian, Mayan, and Indian art) have created bas-reliefs.
Today bas-reliefs are commonly found in a variety of media, commemorative medals, coins, souvenirs, 2.5D animation,and artistic sculptures for blind people. However, crafting bas-reliefs is a laborious, challenging and time-consuming process. And with the commonly and cheaply available 3D printing facilities, there is a growing trend in the need of bas-relief art products.There are many ways to reach the same goals more easily with the help of computers. In the past two decades, a sizable amount of research has gone into developing bas-relief generation methods\cite{benzaid2017analysis}.\\ \\ 
Bas-relief is regarded as an art form part way between 3D sculpture and 2D painting \cite{benzaid2017analysis}\cite{barron2012color}\cite{weyrich2007digital}\cite{kerber2009feature}\cite{kerber2012computer}. Correspondingly, the existing bas-relief generation methods can also be classified in two different categories with respect to their input\cite{benzaid2017analysis}:
\begin{itemize}
 \item 3D model based : using a 3D model (sculpture) as input 
 \item 2D image based : using a 2D image as input 
\end{itemize} 
\subsection{3D model based:} \textbf{How to generate a bas-relief from a 3D sculpture? }The 3D model based bas-relief generation methods focus on such a problem,in which a 3D sculpture is considered as a 3D digital model.   The generation of bas-relief from 3D model was first studied in the pioneering work of \cite{cignoni1997computer}, then various existing 3D model based methods have demonstrated how to compress 3D model into bas-relief \cite{weyrich2007digital}\cite{kerber2009feature}\cite{song2007automatic}\cite{sun2009bas} . However,this approach requires a 3D model as a starting point.
\subsection{2D image based:}\label{2dimagebased} On the other hand,\textbf{ how to generate a bas-relief from a 2D painting?} \\ There have been some bas-relief generation approaches available based on a 2D image \cite{zeng2014region}\cite{wu2013making}  \cite{alexa2010reliefs}\cite{wu2008interactive}.  These approaches almost follow the “bas-relief ambiguity”\cite{belhumeur1999bas}, that is, roughly speaking, from a frontal view the sculpture looks like a full 3D object while a side-view reveals the disproportional depth. 
A 2D painting can be considered as a image,however,these image based methods are focusing on general photograph from real scene,assuming illumination and reflectance are known, and the input image is formed from lighting and shading, which obviously unsuited for 2D paintings.And the generated bas-relief is a single depth map or mesh, which makes it hard for user to edit. \\
Some research focus on bas-relief generation from a line drawing \cite{kolomenkin2011reconstruction}\cite{varley2002estimating}\cite{malik1987interpreting}\cite{sykora2014ink}. However,line drawing based methods generate bas-relief without consideration for surface details: their approaches are limited to using information contained in a line drawing, which is not suited for paintings containing information such as color,texture and stroke shape. \\ \\
Reconstructing a surface given a single 2D image is an ill-posed problem in general. As described in most of the papers on 2D image based algorithms, the problem that manifests itself immediately is that there is no complete knowledge of the depth within a single image.However, with the purpose of generating bas-relief with acceptable quality, there are several factors to be considered specifically for the framing of the problem.\cite{benzaid2017analysis} describes the some core important factors in the bas-relief generation process: depth information, silhouettes and edges,fine details.\\
\textbf{Depth information:} Within a single image there is no complete knowledge of the depth. A reasonable interpretation must be determined in some manner. \\ 
\textbf{Silhouettes and Edges:} Generally, silhouettes and edges are used for separate object and background and generating a reasonable contrast between the foreground objects and the background as a starting establishment for interpreting heights. \\
\textbf{Fine Details:} Many images will contain many small features and details within the subject of the image. In the process of generate bas-relief from 2D images,small features and details are preferable to maintain.Examples are features like texture of a hand or the shininess of an apple. \\ 
In our work, we evaluate our result and compare with other alternative methods based on these three factors, see Section \ref{compare}. \\ \\ 

\section{Aim and Challenges}
As mentioned above, bas-relief is considered as a art form part way between 2D painting and a full 3D sculpture\cite{benzaid2017analysis}\cite{weyrich2007digital}\cite{kerber2009feature}\cite{kerber2012computer}\cite{zeng2014region} .And among all the sculpture forms, bas-relief is the closest to 2D paintings,as claimed by \cite{kerber2009feature} \cite{barron2012color}, while how to generate bas-relief from  paintings remains a problem .\\ 
The aim of our research is to provide a method to generate a bas-relief from a Chinese painting automatically. We also argue that because most Chinese paintings are produced with individual brush strokes, generating bas-relief surface from each brush stroke would preserve the original features of the painting.\\ 
A Chinese painting can be regarded as the union of brush strokes \cite{xu2006animating}. Most Chinese paintings are typically sparse with each brush stroke drawn very purposefully\cite{smith1997art},and each stroke exists on its own as a piece of art\cite{girshick2004simulating}.
Differing from the other bas-relief generation methods, our method will preserve this very feature by generating bas-relief surfaces from the brush strokes individually. 
This however demands to conquer several challenges.\\ 
First, unlike photograph,opacity of brush strokes is a important feature of Chinese painting. It is desired to preserve this feature on bas-relief.\\ Second,unlike previous 2D image based methods focusing on photograph, a Chinese painting does not obey the rules of lighting and shading, which increase the difficulty to mimic the details on bas-relief surface. \\Third, each brush stroke covers a region on the canvas and they may overlap each other, some quite heavily in a painting. To make sure the information is retained, every brush stroke has to be faithfully extracted. \\  \\

\section{Motivation}
The motivation of this research comes from three sides.\\First,as mentioned above, bas-relief is regarded as a art form part way between 2D painting and a full 3D sculpture, as claimed by many previous works \cite{benzaid2017analysis}\cite{weyrich2007digital}\cite{kerber2009feature}\cite{kerber2012computer}\cite{zeng2014region}. Research so far has been primarily done based on a 3D model,and some other methods based on a single photograph\cite{zeng2014region}\cite{wu2013making}  \cite{alexa2010reliefs}\cite{wu2008interactive} or a line drawing \cite{kolomenkin2011reconstruction}\cite{varley2002estimating}\cite{malik1987interpreting}\cite{sykora2014ink} as input. However,how to generate bas-relief from artistic paintings remains a problem .\\
Second, due to the various styles of painting, it is difficult to come up with a general bas-relief generation method suitable for all 2D paintings. Some paintings may be too abstract for bas-relief generation. One the other hand, for traditional Western painting style developed in the Renaissance,which emphasizes realism\cite{chu2004real}, previous 2D image based methods may easily handle.\\
On the other hand,the style and philosophies of Chinese paintings have influenced other painting styles \cite{chu2004real}. Study bas-relief generation from Chinese painting will naturally push forward the research frontier of bas-relief generation from other painting. \\
Third, Bas-relief generation has wide applications in making objects such as commemorative medals, coins, souvenirs, and artistic sculptures for blind people.With the commonly and cheaply available 3D printing facilities, there is a growing trend in the need of bas-relief art products. On the other hand, and as input of our bas-relief generation method, the digital image of Chinese paintings are easily accessible on the Internet.    \\
Therefore, designing an efficient method for bas-relief generation from Chinese painting is important both theoretically and practically.\\ \\

As mentioned above, previous bas-relief generation methods have demonstrate how to generated bas-relief from 3D models,photographs and line drawings. In contrast, this research is the first attempt to automatic generate bas-relief from a Chinese painting. \\
In contrast with previous 2D image based methods, our algorithm is also the first attempt to generate bas-relief from opacity, and we demonstrate that in Chinese painting, opacity can preserve more details than intensity. \\
Accompanying with this method, we have proposed an algorithm for brush stroke extraction.The major difference between our brush stroke extraction with the previous works is that our algorithm is based on a reformulated layer decomposition algorithm, which makes it capable of extraction overlapped brush strokes without the prior knowledge of brush strokes. And we demonstrate the our method have a better performance in brush stroke extraction comparing with another notable work  \cite{li2012restoration} (see Section  \ref{comparevan}).  \\
Most Chinese paintings are typically sparse with each brush stroke drawn very purposefully\cite{xu2006animating}, and such a feature can be found other painting styles,such as rosemailing painting\cite{smith1997art}. So our method is also suitable for rosemailing painting, as shown in Section \ref{more results} and Section \ref{editing}.
