\chapter{CONCLUSIONS }

Bas-relief may be generated from both 3D models and 2D paintings. Our approach can effectively extract brush strokes from 2D paintings and generate the individual depth maps for bas-relief composition in 3D. Since the depth maps of brush strokes are independent of each other, the order and shape may be redefined by the users. It is suitable for Recomposition in bas-relief designs.\\
\textbf{Limitations} In our implementation, we employ layer decomposition in order to split the overlapped brush strokes into different layers, so that the strokes can be easily segmented within one layer.
