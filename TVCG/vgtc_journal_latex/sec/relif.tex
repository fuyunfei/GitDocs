\section{ Relief Generation}

In Chinese paintings, each brushstroke is often introduced to depict something specific in the real world.
Thus, the output of our stroke-based decomposition of these paintings is a set of graphical objects that are meaningful with regard to the set of real objects the paintings depict. It is natural to generate depth information from brushstrokes,here,we present a relief generation method based brushstrokes. \cite{xu2006animating}

And based on \cite{yeh2017interactive}'s method, we can successfully generate high relief model from brush strokes. 

\subsection{comparison}
Next, we compare our results with a closely-related recent work \cite{yeh2017interactive}. In particular, we compare the visual plausibility of the results, with large rotations from the original viewing direction (please refer to the supplementary video, available online, for animated versions of the comparison). 
Following with our method, we compare our method with its approach in three aspect,eventually the output should satisfy
